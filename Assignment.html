Overview: Many clinical studies last for a limited number of years and hence, cannot produce statistics on patient survival time. Instead, they report the percentage of participants who survived beyond, for example, 5 years. In this homework, we would like to calibrate our survival simulation model using the results of a clinical study that followed a cohort of 573 patients over 5 years.
Problem 1: Five-Year Survival (Weight 1): Modify the survival model so that you can get the ‚Äúpercentage of patients survived beyond 5 years‚Äù after simulating a cohort.
Problem 2: Likelihood Assumption (Weight 1): If the probability of 5-year survival is ùëû, what probability distribution ‚Äúthe number of participants that survived beyond 5 years in a cohort of ùëÅ participants‚Äù would follow? Make sure to also specify the parameters of this distribution.
Hint: Review the probability distributions that are discussed at the end of the Review of Probability class notes.
Problem 3: Likelihood Calculation (Weight 1): If our survival model represents the reality, then the ‚Äúpercentage of patients survived beyond 5 years‚Äù (calculated in Problem 1) will represent the true probability of 5-year survival (ùëû in Problem 2). Write a Python statement to calculate the likelihood that a clinical study reports 400 of 573 participants survived at the end of the 5-year study period if 50% of the patients in our simulated cohort survived beyond 5 years?
Hint: Review the list of discrete probability distributions available in Python here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html. Use the pmf method (which returns probability mass function) on the distribution you selected in Problem 2.
Problem 4: Calibration (Weight 3): Calibrate the survival model (with patient cohort size of 1,000) using the results of the clinical study described above (i.e. 400 of 573 participants survived at the end of the 5- year study period). Report the estimated annual mortality probability and the 95% credible interval.
Problem 5: Projection (Weight 3): Use the calibrated model to estimate the mean survival time of the cohort of size 1,000. Report the 95% projection interval.
Problem 6: Projection (Weight 1): Recalibrate the model against a clinical study that reports 800 of 1146 participants survived at the end of the 5-year study period. What changes do you observe in the credible interval of the estimated annual mortality probability and in the projection interval of the mean survival time?
